1)GradientHeatmap_batch.m

First pops up first frame of first window, to define the ROI via user clicks.
Then bins and normalizes positions of animals over time, stores them in 3D matrix HMnorm, needs *als.mat files annd the 
original video in a folder.


2) GradientTimecourseProfile.m

Makes normalized profiles of animals postions i arena for several timepoints.

%-----------------------

Weathervaning:


1)WeatherVaningHF_15hz_center.m

Needs *als.mat files as input.
For each good track(too short, too slow, too wobbling, not moving get excluded) takes data for central area 
and stores data only for runs in matrix (XY, bearing etc): rinunfo**.mat file


2)weathervaning_plots_multi.m(deg/s) or weathervaning_speed_normalized_multi.m(rad/mm)

plots weathervaning barplots (needs 1 or more runinfo files as input)


3)weathervaning_stats.m

takes or various genotypes/conditions all data from central 40-150 degree bin and barplots the turning bias value, needs runinfo as input 
and a Genotype\control or gradient\runinfo*.mat folder structure.



%-------------

Speed modulation:

1)speed_plots_pooled.m

Needs runinfo file as input.Plots mean speed vor several bearing bins over various genotypes. 
Needs a Genotype\control or gradient\runinfo*.mat folder structure.
